# Supply Chain Analytics – EDA & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing supply chain data to uncover patterns,
identify bottlenecks, and understand key factors affecting order demand
and delivery performance.

The project is designed as an end-to-end analytics workflow:
•⁠  ⁠Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•⁠  ⁠Data cleaning and preprocessing
•⁠  ⁠Feature engineering
•⁠  ⁠Machine learning modeling (planned)

This repository is part of my AI/ML portfolio as I transition into
Data Analyst / Machine Learning roles.

## 🎯 Business Objective
To help supply chain stakeholders:
•⁠  ⁠Understand demand patterns
•⁠  ⁠Identify delays and inefficiencies
•⁠  ⁠Support data-driven decision making
•⁠  ⁠Build predictive models for future demand/performance
